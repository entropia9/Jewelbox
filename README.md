# Jewelbox

A Match-3 game, now semi-abandoned. The main feature set of Jewelbox, compared to average modern Match-3 game was supposed to have:

- Custom graphics, own artstyle and music (instead of royalty-free or asset-store sprites)
- Classic match-3 gameplay, unrestricted by turn count, timer or quirky levels with win conditions. Just pure match-3 gameplay on an 8x8 board.
- No ads.
- Maximized control over the board thanks to having special abilities activated by the player when needed and where needed.
